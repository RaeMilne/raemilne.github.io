          <h3>A system for sharing process and project documentation</h3>

    <div id="description">

      <p>Moment’s extranet is used to share work with clients and collaborators. The page templates hadn’t been updated in several years, and previous attempts to modernize the system had been unsuccessful. Working in week-long agile sprints, my partner and I created user-friendly templates based on Markdown that are easy to use and reflect Moment’s recent brand refresh. We also wrote extensive help resources and crafted best practices for project documentation.</p>

    <h3>A tool for launching marketing campaigns</h3>

<div id="description">
    <p>A major financial institution used internal technology to manage reward campaigns for their line of consumer credit cards. Their original software was broken up into multiple tools developed by engineers over two decades. We were tasked with consolidating and updating the software. Our process began with an extensive user-centered research phase where we audited the current toolset and the workflows of multiple users to identify pain points and opportunities.</p>
